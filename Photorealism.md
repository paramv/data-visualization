# Photorealism
* Photorealistic shading methods
* Occlusion, shadowing, perspecive, focus,
lighting etc
* Cues that trick our brain into thinking a 2d image is 3d

## Occlusion
* Strongest cue for photorealism
* Visual sort from near to far
* Most objects are opaque and hide the ones behind them

## Illumination
* Diffuse vs specular
* Diffuse - facing a light source, rough/smooth objects
* Specular - reflecting a light source, metallic/shiny objects

# Non-photorealism
* Why?
* Based on art/psychology of perception. screw physics
* Capture more information while retaining 3D properties
* For example - a photgraph of a heart is real but does not reveal a lot of information. An illustration of a heart gives a lot more information while still being in 3D
* Non-photorealistic lighting/shading adds more information
