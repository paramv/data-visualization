# The Human Retina
* How does the eye sense light?
* How small can the details be? 
* What color do we use?

## Visual Acuity
* Angular resolution of retina
* Snellen Ratio 20/X - what can you distinguish at 20 feet that the average person can perceive at X feet

## Retinal Processing
* cones - red, blue and green
* rods - brightness
* Rods measure intensity; about 80 million in number; denser away from the fovia and are not in the center of vision

## Chromatic Aberration
* Refractive index varies for different wavelengths
* Affects focus
* Which is why we have light enhancing glasses

## Color Perception
* Luminance L = 31% R + 59% G + 10% B
* Add more cues other than color to aid color blind users
* Eye color space
	* Y=R+G,Y-B,R-G
	* Color space is black<->white,yellow<->blue, red <-> green
* We tend to focus on warmer colors and bring them to the forefront
