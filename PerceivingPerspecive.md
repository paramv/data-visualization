# Perceiving Perspective
* How do we perceive a 3D world from the 2D image on our retina?

## Perspective
* Foreshortening - the depth edges on a cube is shorter
* Linear Perspective - objects farther away are smaller
* Size constancy - objects don't change size, so if an object becomes smaller it must be moving away from us
