# Overview of Visualization
* Mathematical Visualization
	* Mandelbroth Visualization
* Scientific Visualization
	* Interactive
	* Data measured or via lengthy simulations
	* Coordinate Data
		* Spatial coordinates
		* Temperature, pressure etc
		* Time can be a spatial coordinate
* Information Visualization
	* Abstract, non-coordinate
	* Relies on processing abstract data into a more concrete form that can be perceived
* Domain specific visualization
	* Medical imaging
	* BI
	* Educational
	* GIS

## Modes of visualization
### Interactive Viz
	* For discovery
	* For single invetigator/collaborators
	* Rerenders based on input
	* Prototype quality only

### Presentation Viz
	* For communication
	* For large group or mass audience
	* No user input support
	* Highly polished - example video

### Interactive Storytelling
	* In between the two
